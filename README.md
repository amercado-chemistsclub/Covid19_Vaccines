Informational Resources on Covid19 vaccines under development

Now that we’re nearing the arrival of vaccines by the end of 2020, these are some resources to provide technical information on the preliminary vaccines that are going for full FDA approval. 
It includes their own publications as well as 3rd party ones. In addition, you can learn more about all of the vaccines beyond the news headlines by going to journal publications such as Nature.

It looks like the rollout of the first vaccines to prevent Covid-19 are now supposed to work against the increased infections from the mutated strains of the  virus. What this means in the long run for testing the efficacy of  the vaccines against these strains is now being determined from these recent reports on the lab studies underway.

The latest study on one variant seems to indicate that one can still get re-infected despite having antibodies from a recent Covid19 infection.  And the current vaccines may not be able to exhibit the same high efficacies that were demonstrated in the trials against  this new strain.

But one vaccine manufacturer, Moderna,  has already conducted studies on the new strains with its current FDA approved dosage. Their results so far indicate that the current  dosing regimen can be enhanced with a booster shot for the new strains according to their preliminary results.

In addition, the other mRNA vaccine dosage by Pfizer/Biontech  was tested on the prominent Covid-19 variant, the UK strain, and determined to exhibit the same vaccine neutralization against it as it demonstrated against the original Wuhan strain in the clinical trials.

However, the initial laboratory study conducted on the other variant, the prominent South Africa strain, shows that it drops the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine neutralization by roughly two thirds when compared to the original strain.

And Moderna, the other mRNA vaccine manufacturer, reported that the same South African strain reduced neutralizing antibody levels by a factor of 2.7 in  laboratory measurements.

Meanwhile, the protein subunit Covid-19 vaccine developed by Novavax had been tested in different global trials on the new UK and South African strains. The vaccine’s efficacy only dropped from approximately 96%  to approximately 86% for the UK strain. However, the drop in efficacy was more dramatic to approximately 49% for the South African strain.
