Informational Resources on Covid19 vaccines under development

Now that we’re nearing the arrival of vaccines by the end of 2020, these are some resources to provide technical information on the preliminary vaccines that are going for full FDA approval. 
It includes their own publications as well as 3rd party ones. In addition, you can learn more about all of the vaccines beyond the news headlines by going to journal publications such as Nature.

It looks like the rollout of the first vaccines to prevent Covid-19 are now supposed to work against the increased infections from the mutated strains of the  virus. What this means in the long run for testing the efficacy of  the vaccines against these strains is now being determined from these recent reports on the lab studies underway.
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00031-0

The latest study on one variant seems to indicate that one can still get re-infected despite having antibodies from a recent Covid19 infection.  And the current vaccines may not be able to exhibit the same high efficacies that were demonstrated in the trials against  this new strain. 
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.427166v1

But one vaccine manufacturer, Moderna,  has already conducted studies on the new strains with its current FDA approved dosage. Their results so far indicate that the current  dosing regimen can be enhanced with a booster shot for the new strains according to their preliminary results.
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.25.427948v1

In addition, the other mRNA vaccine dosage by Pfizer/Biontech  was tested on the prominent Covid-19 variant, the UK strain, and determined to exhibit the same vaccine neutralization against it as it demonstrated against the original Wuhan strain in the clinical trials. 
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.18.426984v1

However, the initial laboratory study conducted on the other variant, the prominent South Africa strain, shows that it drops the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine neutralization by roughly two thirds when compared to the original strain.

And Moderna, the other mRNA vaccine manufacturer, reported that the same South African strain reduced neutralizing antibody levels by a factor of 2.7 in  laboratory measurements.
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102179?query=featured_home

Meanwhile, the protein subunit Covid-19 vaccine developed by Novavax had been tested in different global trials on the new UK and South African strains. The vaccine’s efficacy only dropped from approximately 96%  to approximately 86% for the UK strain. However, the drop in efficacy was more dramatic to approximately 49% for the South African strain. 
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00268-9

The other vaccine manufacturers started to read out their trial data with the inclusion of regional trials where the variants were more dominant than the original strain

Astra Zeneca’s  recombinant viral vector vaccine did not exhibit  any degree of efficacy in protection against the South African variant that was at the level of the  efficacy of 75% in protection against the original Wuhan variant. 
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.10.21251247v1

Initially, Johnson and Johnson’s recombinant viral vector vaccine data showed an overall efficacy of 66%  in preventing the Covid infection across different geographical regions. It was 72% effective in preventing Covid-19 in the US but it dropped to 66% In Latin America and 57% in South Africa, which had a greater percentage of the variants in its population. 
https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/29/jj-one-dose-covid-vaccine-is-66-effective-a-weapon-but-not-a-knockout-punch

By the time that Johnson and Johnson received the EUA from the FDA, the data showed better results by preventing a severe disease outcome from Covid-19 infection of approximately 82% with their single dose. 
https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/24/new-data-shed-light-on-efficacy-of-jjs-single-dose-vaccine-against-covid-19/

In the UK, the studies that were conducted after their vaccine deployment showed that the vaccine efficacy for the Pfizer/Biontech mRNA  type was  up to 90%  against the Covid-19 infection after just a single dose and  the period after vaccination was up to 21 days before final testing.

The question of transmission of the Covid-19 virus after vaccination was addressed by the Isreali study on the Pfizer/Biontech mRNA vaccine where the reduction in the viral concentration was up to 4 fold and thereby reduce the infectious spread of Covid-19. 
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.06.21251283v1.full-text

But the recombinant viral vector vaccine types (developed by Astra Zeneca and Johnson and Johnson) were starting to produce blood clotting side effects in a few cases as reported and tracked by the European Health Agency, where they first occurred. 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/meeting-highlights-pharmacovigilance-risk-assessment-committee-prac-6-9-april-2021

Initially, the distribution of the Astra-Zeneca vaccine was suspended by EU countries and the  distribution of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine was suspended in the US due to the blood clotting effects. The side effect in the small number of patients lead to the initial studies in understanding the root cause of the effect.

In the US, the FDA regulators decided to halt the pause in the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for a variety of reasons after the EU regulators decided to resume the distribution of the Astra-Zeneca vaccine.

More data on the effects of Covid-19 variants  on the efficacy of the currently approved and widely distributed  vaccines are becoming available as new outbreaks around the world increase. 
From one of the latest reviews on Covid spike protein mutations, there was more evidence of their resistance to the ability of the  vaccine antibodies to neutralize them.   https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-021-00573-0

In addition, the lifetime of Covid antibodies, acquired from either receiving the vaccination or from infection, is being studied to see if  they can last up to 11 months before a booster shot may be required. 
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01442-9?utm_source=Nature+Briefing&utm_campaign=6642113fdd-briefing-dy-20210527&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c9dfd39373-6642113fdd-45985486

After the global distribution of  Covid-19 vaccines for more than 6 months, the most experience and the most data on the their impact on the pandemic  is seen in several countries from this review. 
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01505-x

The Indian variant (i.e. Delta) was the one that was closely being studied  for its higher transmission and ability to evade  the current vaccines through  breakthrough infections after the severe outbreak in one country spreads to others. 
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01274-7?utm_source=Nature+Briefing&utm_campaign=9a8cc368a5-briefing-dy-20210511&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c9dfd39373-9a8cc368a5-45985486

The rise in the Covid-19 infection rate in the UK and US, while vaccines are still being distributed to unvaccinated segments of the global population, can be attributed to the higher transmissibility of the Delta variant. The mutation in the variant is projected to increase transmission to  between 40 to 60%  over the original UK variant. Despite the increase in hospitalizations, there’s not enough data evidence that  the Delta variant appears to be more deadly than the other variants.
https://coronavirus.nautil.us/is-the-delta-variant-more-deadly/

The testing of the currently deployed vaccines for protection against the Delta (i.e. Indian) variant was conducted in a UK study of adenovirus vector (Astra Zeneca) and mRNA vaccines. The study for prevention against Covid hospitalization and serious symptoms showed that the second dose  of  Pfizer/Biontech was instrumental in maintaining  the efficacy  by up to 88%, while for the Astrazeneca vaccine it was up to 60%. However,a single dose from either vaccine type had an  average 33% efficacy in reducing the risk of symptomatic infection. 
https://khub.net/web/phe-national/public-library/-/document_library/v2WsRK3ZlEig/view_file/479607329?_com_liferay_document_library_web_portlet_DLPortlet_INSTANCE_v2WsRK3ZlEig_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fkhub.net%3A443%2Fweb%2Fphe-national%2Fpublic-library%2F-%2Fdocument_library%2Fv2WsRK3ZlEig%2Fview%2F479607266

The extent of reduction in the efficacy of the vaccines from the new Delta variant could be based on the frequency of doses given for the different types. The adenovirus vector vaccine that is a single dose by Johnson and Johnson was shown to be less effective than the 2 dose mRNA vaccines by the other companies. In the study conducted, antibody levels in  the single dose vaccine  were 5 to 7 times lower when exposed to the variants, such as the Delta  and Lambda variants, whereas the levels were only 2.5 to 5 times lower in the mRNA vaccines. 
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.19.452771v1.full.pdf

The results are consistent with the earlier UK study that involved the Astra Zeneca vaccine even though it was a small lab sample study. 

The increase in breakthrough infections by the Delta variant was being reported in countries where a high percentage of the people were vaccinated, such as Israel and the UK. The extensive study in Israel on the diminishing efficacy of the mRNA Covid vaccines over time was conducted in various age groups. The Pfizer/Biontech vaccine efficacy against the Delta variant infection and its spread dropped to approximately 40% when various age groups were monitored for protection up to the 6 month interval. However, the protection against severe Covid-19 symptoms and hospitalization was still above 88% at that time.

In addition, a study in the UK showed that efficacy against the Delta variant Covid infection will drop over time after the initial full vaccination with both doses. It dropped to 78% after 90 days for the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine while the Astra Zeneca vaccine dropped to  61% efficacy in 90 days as well. This trend in the efficacy decrease over time is compelling countries, where vaccination is high, to consider authorization for booster shots by 6 months from the various manufacturers. 
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02261-8

In another study from the US Mayo Clinic, the efficacy of the mRNA vaccines was studied to track the overall decrease in efficacy before a booster shot may be required. It showed that over a 6 month period the effectiveness of Pfizer/Biontech’s vaccine dropped down to 42% against the infection by the  Delta variant. However, the drop in  efficacy for the Moderna vaccine was only 76% over the same time period. The study was limited to the mRNA  vaccines approved in the US. 
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.21261707v1.full.pdf

An EU study showed that a full dose of the  Moderna mRNA vaccine created more antibodies titers than Pfizer’s vaccine. The study attributed it to the higher vaccine dosage that one receives with the Moderna vaccine as well as the longer time interval between doses.

The increase in Covid infected hospitalization cases from the Delta variant was monitored against the original UK variant in a large sample  study in the UK. The risk of hospitalization for both was derived from the total case counts for patients; it was 5.5% of cases leading to hospitalization for the Delta variant vs 3.9% of cases  for the alpha variant for those unvaccinated or 3 weeks after receiving one dose.

However, it order to determine how high the projected increase in Covid infection  from the Delta variant is for any specific region, refer to the models already developed.
